# Problem statement :
Oil spills devastate marine ecosystems, harming countless creatures and disrupting delicate habitats. Existing detection methods using satellites are too slow, leaving animals vulnerable during crucial response times. We need a faster and more accessible solution to save life underwater.


# Proposed solution :
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to identify oil spills using satellite images, aiding in protecting marine life. By classifying spills early, we can contribute to the UN's "Life Below Water" goal and promote sustainable ocean use.
