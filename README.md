# Problem statement 
Oil spills devastate marine ecosystems, harming countless creatures and disrupting delicate habitats. Existing satellite detection methods are too slow, leaving animals vulnerable during crucial response times. We need a faster and more accessible solution to save lives underwater.


# Proposed solution 
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to identify oil spills using satellite images to protect marine life. By classifying spills early, we can contribute to the UN's "Life Below Water" goal and promote sustainable ocean use.
